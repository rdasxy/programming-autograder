Swap the keys/values in a Dictionary
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<br><br>
This drill will test your knowledge of how to manipulate the keys/values of a dictionary.
<br>
You will need to write a function with the following interface:
<br><br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp switchDict(dictionary)
<br><br>
The function must be called switchDict (you may call the parameter anything you like).
<br>
The function should take the given dictionary and swap the key/value.  So what was previously the key will now be the value, and what was previously the value will now be the key.  The function should then return the new dictionary.

<br>
You may assume that all values in the dictionary are unique.  (Food for thought: how would you deal with values that are not unique?)

<br><br>
Example:
<br>
If the dictionary looks like this: 
<br>
{'hi':1, 'hello':2, 'howdy':3}

<br>
Then the new dictionarly will look like this after running your function:
<br>
{1:'hi', 2:'hello', 3:'howdy'}
