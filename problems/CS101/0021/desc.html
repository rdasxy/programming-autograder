Write a function to calculate Pascal's Triangle to a certain level of numbers.<br /><br />

The rows of Pascal's triangle are conventionally enumerated starting with row n = 0 at the top. The entries in each row are numbered from the left beginning with k = 0 and are usually staggered relative to the numbers in the adjacent rows. A simple construction of the triangle proceeds in the following manner. On row 0, write only the number 1. Then, to construct the elements of following rows, add the number directly above and to the left with the number directly above and to the right to find the new value. If either the number to the right or left is not present, substitute a zero in its place. For example, the first number in the first row is 0 + 1 = 1, whereas the numbers 1 and 3 in the third row are added to produce the number 4 in the fourth row.<br /><br />

An example would look like:
<pre>
         1
       1   1
     1   2   1
   1   3   3   1
</pre>
and so on. You can look up more information about this problem online.<br /><br />

Ask the user "How many levels?" Print out that many levels of the triangle on screen. You can left-align it with one space between numbers. For example, four levels would look like:
<pre>
1
1 1
1 2 1
1 3 3 1
</pre>
Hint: To do this in Python, you should use a dict. If the kth number in level n is C[(n,k)], then C[(n,k)] = C[(n-1),r] + C[(n-1,r-1)]. With this formula, the first level is level 0.<br /><br />

Name your program pascals.py.
