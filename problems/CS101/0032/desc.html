Write a program that will ask "Enter a string:" and will return "yes" or "no" if it is or isn't a palindrome. (A palindrome is a phrase that is the same forwards and backwards, like "racecar" or "Madam, I'm Adam") Write this function recursively.<br /><br />

For this problem, ignore everything but letters and ignore case.<br /><br />

Name the problem palindrome.py.
