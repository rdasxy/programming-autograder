The Collatz Conjecture states that you take any natural number n. If n is even, divide it by 2 to get n/2. If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1 to obtain 3n + 1. Repeat the process indefinitely. The conjecture is that no matter what number you start with, you will always eventually reach 1.<br /><br />

Prompt the user "Enter an integer:" You will do the calculations, and then print out the largest number out of all of the steps. So, if it is even, divide by 2, or if it is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1. Continue these steps until you get to 1. Finally, print the largest number.<br /><br />

Examples:<br />
<pre>
Enter an integer:5
16

Enter an integer:52
52
