Write a program that will ask "Enter an integer:" and "Enter a second integer:" Then using a recursive function, calculate the index of the two numbers and print it on screen.<br /><br />

So if the first number is A and the second number is B, then the index is the number of times that B divides A. It is the maximum exponent S such that B^S divides A.<br /><br />

Name the problem recursiveindex.py.
