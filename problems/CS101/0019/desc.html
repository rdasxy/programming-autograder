<div>
You will write a function called pay that takes two parameters, the number of hours worked and the rate of pay per hour, and will return the amount of pay the person has earned. If the person has worked over 40 hours, they earn time and a half.<br /><br />

You will download a program called pay.py which will test your function.<br /><br />

Name your program solution.py.
