<div>
Write a program that will perform a Caesar cipher. Ask the user "How many numbers to shift?" then ask the user to "Type in a string." Take each letter of the string and shift it that many numbers. (For example, if they want to shift 4 letters, then 'a' becomes 'e', 'b' becomes 'f', etc.) If it goes past 'z', go back to 'a'. Assume the string only has lower-case letters and no punctuation. Use dicts for this problem.<br /><br />

Name the problem caesarcipher.py.
