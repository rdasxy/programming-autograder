Remove an item from a Dictionary

This drill will test your knowledge of how to remove an item from a dictionary.
<br>
You will need to write a function with the following interface:
<br><br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp removeItem(dictionary, key to remove)
<br><br>
The function must be called removeItem, and the order of the parameters matters (though you may call the parameters anything you like).
<br>
The function should take the given dictionary and key, and remove the key/value from the dictionary.  The function should print the value that was removed from the dictionary, and then on a separate line print the modified dictionary.  The function will not return a value.
<br><br>
Example:
<br>
If given a dictionary like this:
<br>
{1:'red', 2:'blue', 3:'green', 4:'yellow'}
<br><br>
Then after removing an item from the dictionary, like the item with key "1", the dictionary will then look like this:
<br>
{2:'blue', 3:'green', 4:'yellow'}
