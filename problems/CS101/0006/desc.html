<div>
Prompt the user to "Type in a sentence." Read in a line of text, then print out the longest word. In case of multiple words of the same length, print the first of the longest ones. (Note: punctuation will count as part of a word. Example "Hello, world" will mean that "Hello," is one word and "world" is another.)<br /><br />

Name your program longestword.py.
