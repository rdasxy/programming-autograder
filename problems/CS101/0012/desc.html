The Collatz Conjecture states that you take any natural number n. If n is even, divide it by 2 to get n/2. If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1 to obtain 3n + 1. Repeat the process indefinitely. The conjecture is that no matter what number you start with, you will always eventually reach 1.<br /><br />

Prompt the user "Enter an integer:" First, print the integer. If it is even, divide by 2, or if it is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1. Continue these steps until you get to 1. Make sure the 1 is printed at the end.<br /><br />
