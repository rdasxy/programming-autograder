The Collatz Conjecture states that you take any natural number n. If n is even, divide it by 2 to get n/2. If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1 to obtain 3n + 1. Repeat the process indefinitely. The conjecture is that no matter what number you start with, you will always eventually reach 1.<br /><br />

Prompt the user "Enter an integer:" You will do the calculations, and then print out the number of steps it takes to go through the math. So, if it is even, divide by 2, or if it is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1. Continue these steps until you get to 1. Finally, print the number of steps it takes.<br /><br />

Examples:<br />
<pre>
Enter an integer:27
112

Enter an integer:150
16
