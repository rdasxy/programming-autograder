Write a program that will ask "Enter a string:" and "Enter a second string:" Convert each string to sets of characters, and then print out the Cartesian product of the two sets.

A Cartesian product is every possible ordered pair of two sets. If you have a set X and a set Y, then the Cartesian product is every ordered pair containing every (x,y) possible.

Example:
<pre>
Enter a string:abc
Enter a second string:def
('c', 'f')  ('a', 'f')  ('a', 'd')  ('a', 'e')  ('b', 'f')  ('c', 'd')  ('b', 'e')  ('c', 'e')  ('b', 'd') 
</pre>

Name the problem cartproduct.py.
