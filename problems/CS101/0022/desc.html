<div>
Write a program that asks the user "Type in a string" Then print out the number of times the most frequent word occurs, and how many words occur with that frequency, both on separate lines. Don't worry about punctuation, just consider a word a group of characters seperated by spaces. Use dicts to keep track of the counts.<br /><br />

Name the problem wordcount.py.
