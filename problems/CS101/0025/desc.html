Write a program that will ask "What's the chemical formula?" Go through each element in the string and add up its atomic weight. Print out the weight rounded to one decimal place on the next line. For example, "H2O" would have two hydrogens (at 1.0 each) and one oxygen (at 16.0) so the total would be 18.0. <br /><br />

On chemical formulas, the number describes the element before it (H2 means two hydrogen atoms). Assume the formula is all capital letters, and are given in the chart below. Also assume any numbers given will be single digits (1-9).<br /><br />

Use the following weights for these elements:<br />
Hydrogen (H) is atomic weight 1.0<br />
Boron (B) is 10.8<br /><br />
Carbon (C) is 12.0<br />
Nitrogen (N) is 14.0<br />
Oxygen (O) is 16.0<br />
Fluorine (F) is 19.0<br />
Phosphorus (P) is 31.0<br />
Sulphur (S) is 32.1<br />
Potassium (K) is 39.1<br />

Name the problem chemform.py.
